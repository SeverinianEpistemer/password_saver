The following program was designed on an Ubuntu distribution with the GNOME desktop environment, this is because GNOME (but many other desktop environments allow it) allows me to set custom shortcuts, so by pressing a key combination I can start the program.

The program generates a password of 14 characters (12 alphanumeric + 2 special characters) and then copies and pastes it. Then it will open a user interface that asks you to enter the name of the service and the email, so save everything to a file.

I have uploaded both the bash script and the python program that runs it (not very useful since the password is pasted as soon as you start the program) for those who want to improve or modify it.
Any advice is welcome, I will improve the project as soon as I have time.
